## Problem description:

* The game board is an empty 3x3 grid.
* There is one human player and one computer player.
* The human player selects an unoccupied position by selecting an integer from 1-9.
* The computer player selects a random unoccupied position.
* If any player selects an occupied position then they forfeit their turn.
* Each player's marker is placed on the board in their selected position.
* After each player's turn the board is checked for game over conditions.
* If any one player's markers fill a horizontal, vertical, diagonal or antidiagonal, then that player wins the game.
